# Tele-Law Case Registration: An Analysis of Demographic and Regional Disparities

### *A project for the IBM SkillsBuild Data Analyst Internship Program*

---

## üìñ Project Overview

This project analyzes case registration data from India's **Tele-Law program**, an initiative to provide legal aid to marginalized communities through Common Service Centers (CSCs). The goal is to identify and understand disparities in service utilization based on **gender**, **caste**, and **geography**. By uncovering these patterns, the analysis aims to provide data-driven insights for improving the inclusivity and effectiveness of legal aid delivery across the country.

## üìú Problem Statement



> Despite the expansion of the Tele-Law initiative across states and districts, there is limited understanding of demographic utilization patterns and regional disparities in legal aid access. The challenge is to analyze Tele-Law case registration data to uncover gender-wise, caste-wise, and geographic disparities in service utilization across CSCs. Uneven representation among marginalized groups (SC, ST, OBC) and low outreach in certain districts raise concerns about equity and effectiveness...

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the **"District-wise Tele-Law Case Registration and Advice Enabled Data for FY 2021-22 to 2024-25"**.

- **Source:** [data.gov.in](https://www.data.gov.in/resource/district-wise-tele-law-case-registration-and-advice-enabled-data-fy-2021-22-2024-25)
- **Content:** The data contains aggregated case registration counts broken down by district, state/UT, gender (Male/Female), and caste category (General, OBC, SC, ST). It also includes the number of active CSCs in each district.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology & Technologies Used

The analysis was conducted using a Jupyter Notebook and the following technologies:

- **Data Storage:** **IBM Cloud Object Storage** was used to host the dataset, fulfilling a key project requirement.
- **Data Analysis:** **Python** with the **Pandas** library for data manipulation and aggregation.
- **Data Visualization:** **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for creating charts and heatmaps to visualize the findings.
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook on IBM Watson Studio.

## üìà Key Findings

The analysis revealed several key disparities:

1.  **Gender Disparity:** There is a significant gap in service usage, with **Male registrations (24.8 million) far outnumbering Female registrations (15.9 million)**.
2.  **Caste Disparity:** While OBC and SC communities show high engagement, the **Scheduled Tribes (ST) community has the lowest number of registrations (5.4 million)**, suggesting potential barriers to access.
3.  **Geographic Disparity:**
    -   **State-Level:** **Uttar Pradesh** has the highest number of total registrations by a large margin.
    -   **District-Level:** **22 districts reported zero registrations**, despite having active CSCs, indicating major gaps in service outreach or data reporting.
    -   **CSC Effectiveness:** When normalized by the number of CSCs, regions like **Delhi** and **Chandigarh** show the highest registration rates per center, indicating highly effective outreach.
